Evil Morty hijacks the Citadel's central finite curve, exposing the truth about Rick C-137's origins and the multiverse's design. Rick and Morty barely escape as the curve collapses, freeing realities previously walled off.

- Flashbacks confirm Rick's family was killed by another Rick, motivating his crusade against the Council.
- Evil Morty escapes the finite curve, implying his quest for a reality beyond Rick's control.
- Rick and Morty reconcile—briefly—after Morty chooses to stay with him despite their fractured partnership.
- Resolves the long-running Evil Morty arc from "Close Rick-counters" and "The Ricklantis Mixup".
- Clarifies why so many timelines center on Rick being the smartest man in the universe.
- Sets up a multiverse where Ricks are no longer guaranteed superiority, expanding future storytelling possibilities.
