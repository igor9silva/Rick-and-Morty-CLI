# The Ricklantis Mixup

While Rick and Morty head to Atlantis, the Citadel deals with its own political upheaval. The anthology format follows cop Ricks, factory workers, campaign hopefuls, and classroom Mortys whose intersecting stories end with President Morty seizing control.

- President Morty (formerly Evil Morty) stages an election upset, executing the Council of Ricks.
- Cop Rick sacrifices himself to expose corruption, highlighting class divides within the Citadel.
- Simple Rick's wafer factory reveals systemic exploitation, mirroring real-world labor critiques.
- Reintroduces Evil Morty after his season one escape, setting up "Rickmurai Jack".
- Demonstrates the Citadel's ability to function without Rick C-137, a point he resents in later episodes.
- The episode's structure showcases the franchise's willingness to experiment with tone and world-building.
