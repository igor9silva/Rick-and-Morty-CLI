# Rick Potion #9

Rick brews a love potion meant to help Morty impress Jessica. The serum mutates the entire planet, forcing Rick and Morty to abandon their reality and take the place of alternate selves.

- Rick admits he can't undo the mutation, revealing limits to his confidence.
- Morty watches his alternate self die and buries the bodyâ€”one of the show's darkest turning points.
- The Smith family remains on the ruined "Cronenberg Earth," while the protagonists move into a near-identical timeline.
- Establishes the concept of replacing alternate versions, referenced later in "Total Rickall" and "Rickmurai Jack".
- Demonstrates Morty's trauma, which resurfaces in "Morty's Mind Blowers".
- Shows Beth and Jerry thriving amid apocalypse, foreshadowing their resilience in later seasons.
